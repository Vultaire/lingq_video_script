This is a super simple Tampermonkey script that I created to make YouTube
videos larger when using LingQ in a browser.  I'm sharing this quickly in case
it is useful to others, but with NO WARRANTY.

This is a very trivial script and I am releasing it into the public domain.
Use it as you will.  However, I am providing no support for it, and again,
there is no warranty on this whatsoever.
